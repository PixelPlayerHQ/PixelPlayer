/**
 * Orchestrates sending a whole playlist to the watch: syncs the playlist's membership/order
 * first (so the watch can show it, and start playing it, before every song has arrived), then
 * transfers songs that aren't already on the watch one at a time — never in parallel, to avoid
 * saturating the single Bluetooth channel and spiking CPU/battery on the watch (see
 * [WatchAudioTranscoder]'s doc for why the encode itself is also sequential per song).
 *
 * Reuses the existing single-song pipeline end to end: [WatchAudioTranscoder] decides/produces
 * the audio to send, and [PhoneDirectWatchTransferCoordinator] still owns the actual chunked
 * ChannelClient streaming (via its [PhoneDirectWatchTransferCoordinator.WatchAudioOverride] hook)
 * and per-song cancellation.
