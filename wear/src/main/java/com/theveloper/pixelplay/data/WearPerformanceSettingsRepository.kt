/**
 * Watch-side durable cache of the performance toggles configured from the phone's Settings ->
 * "Reloj" screen. [WearDataListenerService] writes into this whenever a
 * `WearDataPaths.WEAR_PERFORMANCE_SETTINGS` DataItem syncs in; [WearLocalPlayerRepository] and the
 * player UI read it reactively. Caching locally (rather than querying the phone live) is the
 * whole point — these need to apply during standalone local playback, exactly when the phone may
 * not be reachable at all.
 *
 * All three default to `true` — current behavior preserved for a watch that's never received a
 * sync (e.g. right after this feature ships, before the user opens the new phone settings screen).
 *
 * Only meaningful during local playback (`WearOutputTarget.WATCH`) — see call sites for why
 * remote-controller mode ignores these entirely.

     * silently. A watch whose local copy is out of sync therefore has no way back on its own —

     * all-`true` defaults, which is exactly that state: the phone still shows the toggles off,
     * the watch behaves as if they were on, and nothing short of the user toggling something on
     * the phone would ever reconcile them.

     * Reading the DataItem is a local Play Services call — the DataItem is already mirrored on
     * the watch — so this works with the phone out of range, and does nothing at all if the user
